# rotris
A tetris-like game, created as my first programming project in early 2019. 
Control by using the keyboard: up to rotate, left/right/down as their respective directions, esc to enter and exit the store. 
There was an attempt to create a bot which would automatically play the game, however I used quite random values within the algorithm and it is in no way optimized. It should be simple to train a machine learning model using variable parameters and a simple reward system if one wishes to do so.
